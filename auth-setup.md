# Authentication Setup Guide

## 1. Configure Supabase Auth

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
3. Configure the following:

### Site URL
```
http://localhost:3000
```
For production, add your actual domain:
```
https://admin.yourdomain.com
```

### Redirect URLs
Add these URLs:
```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard
https://admin.yourdomain.com/dashboard
```

## 2. Create Admin User

In your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Users**
2. Click **Add User**
3. Enter your admin email and password
4. Click **Create User**

## 3. Optional: Restrict Signups

For security, disable public signups:
1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Settings**
2. Turn OFF "Enable email signups"
3. Now only you can create users via the dashboard

## 4. Test the Setup

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000`
2. You'll be redirected to `/login`
3. Enter your admin credentials
4. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard` with full access

## 5. Row Level Security (Optional but Recommended)

Update your RLS policies to only allow authenticated users:

```sql
-- Update policies to require authentication
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON tutors;
CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for authenticated users" ON tutors FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON students;
CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for authenticated users" ON students FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON enquiries;
CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for authenticated users" ON enquiries FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON messages;
CREATE POLICY "Enable all access for authenticated users" ON messages FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

## 6. Production Deployment

When deploying to Vercel:
1. Add your production domain to Supabase Site URL
2. Add redirect URLs for your production domain
3. Update environment variables in Vercel dashboard

Your admin portal is now secured! ðŸ”’
